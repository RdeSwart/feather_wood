            <p class="lead fs-6 text-secondary mb-3">Welcome to Feather and Wood — where play meets purpose.</p>
            <p class="mb-5">At Feather and Wood, we believe that toys should do more than entertain; they should inspire, educate, and foster growth. 
              We are passionate about providing children with tools that encourage creativity, curiosity, and learning through play. 
              Our carefully curated collection features toys that align with the principles of Steiner, Waldorf, Montessori, and STEM education, promoting natural, hands-on exploration.</p>

                    <p class="text-secondary mb-0">We prioritise natural materials, sustainable practices, and ethical production.</p>
                    <p class="text-secondary mb-0">At Feather and Wood, we believe that the foundation of a great toy starts with the materials it's made from. 
                      That's why we carefully select natural, eco-friendly materials that are safe for both your child and the environment. 
                      From sustainably sourced wood to organic cotton and plant-based dyes, we ensure that every product reflects our commitment to sustainability.</p>
                    <p class="text-secondary mb-0">Our toys are crafted with quality craftsmanship in mind, designed to last for generations. 
                      We choose materials that are not only beautiful and tactile but also environmentally responsible. 
                      By working with artisans and manufacturers who share our values, we are able to offer products that have a positive impact on the world around us.</p>

                    <p class="text-secondary mb-0">Our mission is simple: to provide toys that are as timeless as they are purposeful.</p>
                    <p class="text-secondary mb-0">At Feather and Wood, we believe in the power of play to nurture a child’s imagination and development in ways that extend far beyond the moment. 
                      Our toys are designed to be more than just playthings; they are tools for growth that inspire creativity, foster learning, and encourage hands-on exploration.</p>
                    <p class="text-secondary mb-0">We want every toy you bring home to be built to last, both in terms of quality and relevance. 
                      We carefully choose each product to offer endless opportunities for growth and learning, adapting to a child’s changing needs and developmental stages. 
                      Whether it’s a wooden block set, a puzzle, or a craft kit, we ensure that every item sparks a sense of wonder and encourages children to engage with the world in a meaningful way.</p>
